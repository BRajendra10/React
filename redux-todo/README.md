# ðŸ“Œ Todo App â€” Redux + React Router DOM
A simple and responsive Todo application built using React, Redux Toolkit, and React Router DOM. This app allows you to add and delete tasks while maintaining a clean and minimal UI. State management is handled by Redux Toolkit for better scalability, and React Router DOM is used for smooth navigation between pages.

This project is a beginner-friendly example of combining routing with global state management in a React application.
